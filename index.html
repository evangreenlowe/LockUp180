<p>Almost all publicly listed companies have a 180 day "Lock-up" period that prevents directors from selling their stock immediately after the company goes public. Of course, 180 days later, directors have the ability to sell this stock. Using publicly available data from NASDAQ on recently filed IPO (i.e. <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=filings&amp;month=2015-12">www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=filings&amp;month=2015-12</a>) this repository organizes the companies whose 180 Lock-up periods are about to expire</p>

<p>After 180 days, directors will make a choice about how many of their shares to hold - anywhere from 0 to 100% of the fully-vested shares they own. Directors selling off 90% of their shares is plausibly a bad sign of what the insiders think about the future of their company. Conversely, if no shares are sold off, this may be an indicator of their confidence of the upward trajectory of their company's stock value.</p>

<p>Hedgefunds and formal analysts all have access to this information, but until now it wasn't easily available to the everyday casual trader. This is a small step towards equalling the playing field.</p>
